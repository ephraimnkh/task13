# Task 13

This is a task set to be completed by students of a bootcamp.

I was helping a student to complete the task as a tutor and made my own solution in this folder.

The task asked that an app be made that uses session storage to store a user's favorite tracks. The user should be able to see, add, update and delete the tracks as they wish.

The task also asked that a bill calculator for a cafe be implemented using window.prompt to get the cafe order from a user. The final result was to display the total to the user.
